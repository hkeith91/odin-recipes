This is my first website project created following The Odin Project.  It is meant to demonstrate the usage of html basics including: creating boilerplate code, creating logical file structures, and creating working links and images using both relative and absolute links.

This project also serves to practice using Git and Github for both version control and hosting a portfolio of completed work.
