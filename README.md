# odin-recipes

    This is my first project completed for The Odin Project.  It is made to practice and 
demonstrate a knowledge and understanding of html basics, including setting up boilerplate code, 
creating a logical file structure, as well as setting up links and images.  It is also meant to
practice utilizing Git and Github for version control and portfolio hosting.
