<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chef John Comments:</p>
<p>
  "Sweet and succulent pork ribs are never a bad addition to the game day
  buffet, but they can get predictable with the same old rubs and sauces. Here
  we have all the baby back rib-y goodness you know and love, but with the
  flavor profile of sweet Italian fennel sausage.
</p>
<p>
  These really have a wonder flavor, which was further highlighted by the spicy,
  sweet, and tangy orange glaze. My only regret was that I didn't have any
  hotdog buns around, as I would have pulled out the bones and served these just
  like a real sausage sandwich. There's always next time."
