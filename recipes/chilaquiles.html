<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  One of my favorite comfor foods from growing up in Tucson. It's great for a
  potluck or party and you'll get lots of compliments from your guests!
</p>
<p>
  This is a "roja" version but there is a "verde" style too. Both are great and
  can be made hot or mild depending upon your heat tolernaces or preferences.
  Serve with your favorite salsa, if desired.

  <li>
    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a large (10x15-inch) casserole dish.

  <li>
    combine drained tomatoes and chipotle chiles in adobo in a blender and puree
    until smooth.
  </li>

    Sprinkle a layer of Mexican cheese and cotija cheese over top. Add shredded
    chicken to cover all of the chops and cheese. Season chicken with salt and
    pepper, then sprinkle with 1/2 of the green onions and 1/2 of the cilantro.
    Spoon 3/4 of the sour cream evenly over top. Spread with the remaining
    tortilla mixture then rop with remaining Mexican and cotija cheeses. Cover
    with aluminum foil.

    Bake in the preheated oven until mixture is bubbly and cheese is melted, 35
    to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes. Serve with
